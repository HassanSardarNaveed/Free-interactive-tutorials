Tutorial
--------
This tutorial will tell you about comments in python.

Comments allow you to write text that will not be parsed by the language. This means that you can write information about what something does without the program doing anything with it.

In python, a comment is written with the following syntax:
```python	
# Your comment here!
```
Comments can also be at the end of a line:
```python
print("Hello, World")   # Prints "Hello, World"
```
You can use comments to remove code temprarily, or to visually split up sections:
```python
# print("Hello, World")
```
