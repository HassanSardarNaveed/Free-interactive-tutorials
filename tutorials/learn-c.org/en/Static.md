`static` is a keyword in the C programming language. It can be used with variables and functions.

### What is a static variable?
By default, variables are automatic i.e. they gets gets destroyed at the end of scope and gets re-defined at re-rentry to that scope. Variables can be declared as static so that they don't get destroyed at end of scope and to retain the previous value at re-entry of scope.

Consider the following scenario â€“ where we want to count the runners participating in a race:

    #include<stdio.h>
    int runner() {
        int count = 0;
        count++;
        return count;
    }

    int main()
    {
        printf("%d ", runner());
        printf("%d ", runner());
        return 0;
    }

We will see that `count` is not updated because it is removed from memory as soon as the function completes.  If `static` is used however, we get the desired result:

    #include<stdio.h>
    int runner()
    {
        static int count = 0;
        count++;
        return count;
    }

    int main()
    {
        printf("%d ", runner());
        printf("%d ", runner());
        return 0;
    }

### What is a static function?
By default, functions are global in C.  If we declare a function with `static`, the scope of that function is reduced to the file containing it.

The syntax looks like this:

    static void fun(void) {
       printf("I am a static function.");
    }

### Static vs Global?
While static variables have scope over the file containing them making them accessible only inside a given file, global variables can be accessed outside the file too.

Exercise
--------
In this exercise, try to find the sum of some numbers by using the static keyword.  Do not pass any variable representing the running total to the `sum()` function.

Tutorial Code
-------------

   #include <stdio.h>
   int sum (int num) {
       /**
       * find sum to n numbers
       */
   }

   int main() {
       printf("%d ",sum(55));
       printf("%d ",sum(45));
       printf("%d ",sum(50));
       return 0;
   }

Expected Output
---------------

   55 100 150

Solution
--------

   #include <stdio.h>
   int sum (int num) {
       static int total = 0;
       total += num;
       return total;
   }

   int main() {
       printf("%d ",sum(55));
       printf("%d ",sum(45));
       printf("%d ",sum(50));
       return 0;
   }
