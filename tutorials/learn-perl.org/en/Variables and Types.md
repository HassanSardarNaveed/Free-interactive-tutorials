### Basic syntax

The hash (`#`) sign starts a comment (there are no multiline comments)

The semicolon (`;`) is required to end each command line

The simplest way to print text to the screen is using the `print` command. 

	print "this is a text line\n";

Newlines needs to be explicitly defined using `\n`.

The double-quotes (`""`) used to encapsulate a string to be printed allows replacement of variable values inside the string. The single-quote `''` prevents variable value replacement.

	$x = 5;
	print "double quotes allow the variable named x to show its real value of $x\n";
	print 'but within single-quotes - its value of $x is not replaced\n';

### Variables

Perl supports 3 kinds of variables
Scalars - contain a single string or numeric value. Variable name must start with a `$`.
Arrays - contain a randomly accessed ordered set of values. Variable name must start with a `@`.
Hashes - contain (key, value) pairs efficiently accessed per key. Variable name must start with a `%`.

Assigning values to variable is done with the equal sign (`=`). The operand to the left of the `=` sign is the name of the variable, and the operand to the right of the `=` sign is the value stored in the variable. For example some assignments to scalars:

	$item_price = 5;             # An integer assignment
	$item_name = "Apple";        # A string
	print "The price of one $item_name is $item_price gold coins.\n";

For example some assignments to array variables. To refer to a single element of an array, the variable name must start with a `$` followed by the index of the element in square brackets (`[]`). the index of the first array element is 0.

	@item_price_list = (5 , 8 , 24);
	@item_name_list = ("Apple", "Banana", "Mushroom");
	print "The price of one $item_name_list[0] is $item_price_list[0] gold coins.\n";
	print "The price of one $item_name_list[1] is $item_price_list[1] gold coins.\n";
	print "The price of one $item_name_list[2] is $item_price_list[2] gold coins.\n";

For example some assignments to hash variables. To refer to a single element of an array, the variable name must start with a `$` followed by the key of the requested element in curly brackets (`{}`).

	%item_catalog = ("Apple", 5 , "Banana" , 8 , "Mushroom" , 24);
	# note the required backslash to escape the double-quotes around the key string Apple
	print "The price of one Apple is $item_catalog{\"Apple\"} gold coins.\n";
        $item_name = "Banana";
	print "The price of one $item_name is $item_catalog{$item_name} gold coins.\n";
	@item_name_list = ("Apple", "Banana", "Mushroom");
	print "The price of one $item_name_list[2] is $item_catalog{$item_name_list[2]} gold coins.\n";

Exercise
-------------
Assign the hash variable called: car_catalog to include the following car models anc their showroom prices in dollars. Use the car model name as the hash key. The cars and prices are: 

model: BMW Series 5   price: 100000
model: Mercedes 2000  price: 250000
model: Toyota Corolla price:  20000
model: Lexus 3        price:  95000

Assign an array variable called: `my_wishlist` with the two requested car models you wish to buy: The first array element is the full model name of the BMW car and the second array model is the full model name of the Toyota car. Use the array variable's contents as keys to the hash variable in order to print lines in the following format:
I would like to buy one <car model goes here> for the price of <price goes here> Dollars.

For example:

I would like to buy one Lexus 3 for the price of 95000 Dollars.

Tutorial Code
-------------
	%car_catalog = ();
	@my_wishlist = ();
	print "I would like to buy one REPLACE_HERE for the price of REPLACE_HERE Dollars.\n";
	print "I would like to buy one REPLACE_HERE for the price of REPLACE_HERE Dollars.\n";

Expected Output
---------------

	I would like to buy one BMW Series 5 for the price of 100000 Dollars.
	I would like to buy one Toyota Corolla for the price of 20000 Dollars.

Solution
--------
	%car_catalog = ("BMW Series 5", 100000, "Mercedes 2000", 250000, "Toyota Corolla", 20000, "Lexus 3", 95000);
	@my_wishlist = ("BMW Series 5", "Toyota Corolla");
	print "I would like to buy one $my_wishlist[0] for the price of $car_catalog{$my_wishlist[0]} Dollars\n";
	print "I would like to buy one $my_wishlist[1] for the price of $car_catalog{$my_wishlist[1]} Dollars\n";
