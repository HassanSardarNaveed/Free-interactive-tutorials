Tutorial
--------
Perl scalar variable holds a single string or numeric value. Perl supports many operators on scalars:
- concatenations of string values via the "." (dot) operator
- math functions on numeric values: + - * / % ^^ as well as a rich set of functions
- support operation on own variable: += -= .= ++ -- etc.

### Scalar Variable Example

	$item_name = "Apple";
	$item_price = 13.50;
	$item_count = 5;
	print "The total for $item_count $item_name" . "s" . " will be: " . $item_count * $item_price . " Dollars.\n";

### Alternatively

	$total = $item_count * $item_price;
	$item_name_plural = $item_name . "s";
	print "The total for $item_count $item_name_plural will be: $total Dollars.\n";

Exercise
-------------
The Boeing 747-8 is a wide-body jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is 250 feet long, it weighs 987,392 Pounds and costs 357.5 Million US Dollars. A person in Europe asks you to convert the length to meters, the weight to Kilograms and the cost to Euro.
Use the conversion variable values to print 3 lines:

The jet is ______ Meters long.
The jet weighs ______ Kilograms.
The jet costs ______ Million Euro.

Tutorial Code
-------------

	$one_foot_in_meters = 0.3048;
	$one_kilogram_in_pounds = 2.204;
	$one_euro_in_dollars = 1.3;
	print "The jet is ______ Meters long.\n";
	print "The jet weighs ______ Kilograms.\n";
	print "The jet costs ______ Million Euro.\n";
	
Expected Output
---------------

	The jet is 76.2 Meters long.
	The jet weighs 448000 Kilograms.
	The jet costs 275 Million Euro.

Solution
--------

	$one_foot_in_meters = 0.3048;
	$one_kilogram_in_pounds = 2.204;
	$one_euro_in_dollars = 1.3;
	$jet_length_feet = 250;
	$jet_weight_pounds = 987392;
	$jet_cost_m_dollars = 357.5 ;
	print "The jet is " . $jet_length_feet * $one_foot_in_meters . " Meters long.\n";
	print "The jet weighs " . $jet_weight_pounds / $one_kilogram_in_pounds . " Kilograms.\n";
	print "The jet costs " . $jet_cost_m_dollars / $one_euro_in_dollars . " Million Euro.\n";
